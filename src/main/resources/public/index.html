<p>This system processes messages containing the following data (in JSON format):</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Sales Type</li>
    <li>Sales Amount</li>
    <li>Sales Quantity</li>
    <li>Sales Operations</li>
</ul>

Sample request:
<p>{
	"type":"apple",
	"quantity" : 20,
	"amount":"10p",
	"operation":""
}
</p>
<p><b>Assumptions made in this project:</b></p>
1. Sales amount is always in pence (Quantity x Amount will be recorded in &#163;(Pounds))<br>
2. If Sales operation is set, adjustments are to be made on existing record - if current 
sale is 0, no adjustments will be made.<br>
3. If operation is not one of the expected operations, no adjustments will be done. <br>
Expected operations are the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li>ADD</li>
	<li>SUBTRACT</li>
	<li>MULTIPLY</li>
</ul>
